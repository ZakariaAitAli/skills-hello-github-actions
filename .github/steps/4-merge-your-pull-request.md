## Step 4: Merge your workflow file

_You're now able to write and run an Actions workflow! :sparkles:_

Merge your changes so the action will be a part of the `main` branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your workflow file

1. In your repo, click on the **Pull requests** tab.
1. Click on the pull request you created in step 1.
1. Click **Merge pull request**, then click **Confirm merge**.
1. Optionally, click **Delete branch** to delete your `welcome-workflow` branch.
1. Wait about 20 seconds for actions to run, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) and an action will automatically close this step and open the next one.
