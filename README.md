## Welcome

Automation is key for streamlining your work processes, and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) is the best way to supercharge your workflow.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps engineers, students, managers, teams, GitHub users.
- **What you'll learn**: How to create workflow files, trigger workflows, and find workflow logs.
- **What you'll build**: An Actions workflow that will check emoji shortcode references in Markdown files.
- **Prerequisites**: In this course you will work with issues and pull requests, as well as edit files. We recommend you take the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course first.
- **How long**: This course can be finished in less than two hours.

In this course, you will:

1. Create a workflow
2. Add a job
3. Add actions
4. Merge your pull request
5. See the action run

'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
